abstract = {Many eukaryotic cells use the active waving motion of flexible flagella to self-propel in viscous fluids. However, the criterion governing the selection of particular flagellar waveforms among all possible shapes has proved elusive so far. To address this question, we derive computationally the optimal shape of an internally forced periodic planar flagellum deforming as a travelling wave. The optimum is here defined as the shape leading to a given swimming speed with minimum energetic cost. To calculate the energetic cost, we consider the irreversible internal power expended by the molecular motors forcing the flagellum, only a portion of which is dissipated in the fluid. This optimization approach allows us to derive a family of shapes depending on a single dimensionless number quantifying the relative importance of elastic to viscous effects: the Sperm number. The computed optimal shapes are found to agree with the waveforms observed on spermatozoon of marine organisms, thus suggesting that these eukaryotic flagella might have evolved to be mechanically optimal.},

abstract = {{\_}Essential Cell Biology{\_} provides an accessible introduction to the fundamental concepts of cell biology. Its lively writing and exceptional illustrations make it the ideal textbook for a first course in cell and molecular biology. The text and figures are easy-to-follow, accurate, clear, and engaging for the introductory student. Molecular detail has been kept to a minimum in order to provide the reader with a cohesive, conceptual framework of the basic science that underlies our current understanding of biology. The Third Edition is thoroughly updated scientifically, yet maintains the academic level and size of the previous edition. The book is accompanied by a Media DVD-ROM with over 130 animations and videos, all the figures from the book, and a new self-test quizzing feature for students.},

abstract = {1. The general theory of flagellar propulsion is discussed and an expression obtained whereby the propulsive speed of a spermatozoon can be expressed in terms of the amplitude, wave-length and frequency of the waves passing down the tail of a spermatozoon of Psammechinus miliaris.$\backslash$n2. The expression obtained is applicable to waves of relatively large amplitude, and allowance is made for the presence of an inert head.$\backslash$n3. The calculated propulsive speed is almost identical with that derived from observational data. Unless the head of a spermatozoon is very much larger than that of Psammechinus, its presence makes relatively little difference to the propulsive speed. Most of the energy of the cell is used up in overcoming the tangential drag of the tail.$\backslash$n4. Although the amplitude may change as a wave passes along the tail, the propulsive properties of the latter may be expected to be closely similar to those of a tail generating waves of the same average amplitude.},

abstract = {Several brain pathologies could take advantage of local delivery of drugs or electrical stimulation for the treatment of tumors or neurological disorders. A self propelling microdevice could reach remote locations and is available for further precision positioning in time, also after months. In this paper we present a study for the locomotion of such a micro-device. The device is built of piezoelectric actuators that create an undulating motion which is capable of propelling the micro-robot in the brain parenchyma. In order to estimate the feasibility of such device we measured the resonant frequencies of an up-scaled actuator in air and brain tissue mimicking gel and found that it can actually burrow into the tissue. An optimally proposed actuator is able to produce a maximal propulsive velocity of 25 mm/s and propulsive force of 8.7 mN. Relying on a realistic power consumption of 10 mW will reduce the performance to 1 mm/s and 0.34 mN.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel swimming method mediated by traveling waves in elastic tails. The propulsion method is potentially appropriate for maneuvering microrobots inside the human body. The swimming action relies on the creation of a traveling wave along a piezoelectric layered beam divided into several segments. This requires that a voltage with the same frequency, but different phases and amplitudes, be applied to each segment. The swimming pattern was analyzed theoretically by solving the coupled electric-elastic-fluidic problem, and was optimized to attain reasonable thrust. It was found that despite extreme size limitations, a tail manufactured by current microelectromechanical-devices technology, using piezoelectric material, is able to swim in water at a speed of several centimeters per second. The swimming theory was verified experimentally using an upscaled model that produced propulsion of 0.04 mN, which matches closely the theoretically predicted propulsion},
